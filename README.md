# Loan-Approval-Prediction
This project aims to predict loan approval status using multiple Machine Learning algorithms. The dataset includes applicant details such as income, loan amount, credit history, and demographic information.  By applying classification algorithms, we evaluate which model performs best in predicting whether a loan will be approved.
